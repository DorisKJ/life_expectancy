# life_expectancy
The data used in this work contains the life expectancy and probability of survival calculated for a given cohort from 1991 to 2001. This data is available on the Canadian government website. Each dataset is described by income, education, ancestry, gender and residence type.

Life expectancy can be defined as the average of additional years a given person still has to live. It is calculated by observing a given population born in the same year, during a certain period. For such a group of people, referred to (in this case) as a cohort, the probability of survival is the proportion of individuals to be alive after a given time.

This is an exploratory analysis designed to observe the impact of factors such as income, education, ancestry, gender and residence type, on life expectancy. The data used in this work contains the life expectancy and probability of survival calculated for a given cohort from 1991 to 2001. The dataset is available on the [Canadian Government website](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310013401).
